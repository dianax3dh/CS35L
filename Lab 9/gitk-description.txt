After following the instructions and running gitk,
a window popped up. The subwindows in the screenshot:
the top window shows the commits that have been made, by who, 
and when it was made. You can look at each commit in detail by 
clicking on it and it will show in the bottom window. The left
bottom window shows the detail of the commit in diff format
and the right bottom window shows the comments for that commit, which
contains the files that the commit affected.
