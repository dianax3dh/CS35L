less INSTALL
To read how to install it

./configure --prefix="/u/eng/class/classdho/coreutils-7.6/tempDirec"
Found ./configure --prefix=PREFIX(a pathname)
	The temporary directory is tempDirec.

make
To compile package

make install
To install

export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
To change the en_US.UTF-8 locale

./tempDirec/bin/ls -l
./src/ls -l
The ls in both are buggy
They both show the unwated results:
-rw-r--r--  1 classdho class    7658 2009-09-01 04:01 TODO

emacs bradyPatch
To apply Brady's Patch; copy and pasted the patch from assignment
link.

patch -p1 < bradyPatch
man patch to learn that -p1 strips first leading slashes from
a/src/ls.c b/src/ls.c.
It gives me this error: 
     patching file NEWS
     patch: **** malformed patch at line 11: outline -*-
I remove the outline -*-

patch -p1 <bradyPatch
Do this again and it works

make
Ran make again to build the fixed version
Only the ls.c files were modified

After patching, both versions of ls are as follows:
./src/ls -l now gives: (the patched one)
-rw-r--r--  1 classdho class    7658 Sep  1  2009 TODO

./tempDirec/bin/ls -l gives: (the buggy one)
-rw-r--r--  1 classdho class    7658 2009-09-01 04:01 TODO

touch testFile
Created a test file 

touch testFile -t 201501122300 
-t lets you modify the time; YEARMONTHDAYTIME
I made it be dated Jan 12 2015 23hours

This was the result:
-rw-r--r--  1 classdho class       0 Jan 12  2015 testFile

It differs from the rest which looked like this:
drwxr-xr-x  2 classdho class    8192 Oct 16 23:40 po

Running ls with a new file differs from a file older than 1 
year, in which files more than a year old have no time
stamp, as seen above.
