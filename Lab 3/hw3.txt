Q1. Brady's patch remove the line "case_long_iso_time_style:",
because looking at the patch, the line was also removed in the
for loop seen at "-goto case_long_iso_time_style;". Since that line
was removed, the "case_long_iso_time_style:" is no longer needed,
hence it was removed, even though it's not necessary since it would
not have been called on. 

Q2. If my company adopts this patched version of Coreutils 
instead of the default one, some troubles we'd run into if users do
not speak English or understand the formatting, are that the date
is formatted differently at MM/DD/YY, but in some countries it is
formatted as DD/MM/YY, and the month is written in English in the
patched version of Coreutils. 

Q3. python randline.py /dev/null
 When the script is invoked on an empty file like /dev/null, it 
gives this error:  
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/
Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 275, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
# raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range
This is because there are no lines for it to randomly select 
from, making the "self.lines" from line 34 empty, so it is
unable to "chooseLine" from line 64. 

Q4. When this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2, and why?
Running the script with Python 3 gave this error:
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
The error is due to a difference in syntax between
Python 3 and Python 2, or any other older versions of Python.
To fix this error, the correct syntax is
except IOError as err:
       errno, strerror = err.args
