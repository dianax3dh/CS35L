To startup BeagleBone, I began with following the instructions
posted on piazza by the TA. 

ifconfig
inet addr:10.97.85.19

sudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client
After connecting my BeagleBone to the Wifi, I installed OpenSSH.

ssh-keygen
To generate keys.
   -created directoy '/root/.ssh'
   -saved into (/root/.ssh/id_rsa)
   -enter passphrase: hello1

Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
0f:36:54:9b:20:b5:0d:70:d5:c3:bf:77:90:92:ad:11 root@beaglebone
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|      oo=.oo     |
|       o * oE    |
|        o +  * . |
|       .    + =  |
|        S    + o |
|       . +  . . o|
|          .    ..|
|                 |

+-----------------+

sudo useradd -d -m /home/al al
-m creates a new user without creating any home directory for that user
-d followed by full path for desired new home directory 

sudo passwd al
creates a password for the directory
password: al123

cd /home/al 
cd into the directory

sudo mkdir .ssh
creates .ssh directory 

sudo chown -R al .ssh
changes owner of directory to "root" 
-R recursively changes ownership of directories and their contents

sudo chmod 700 .ssh
700 lets the owner read, write, and execute in .ssh directory 

Al's inet addr:  10.97.85.20
ssh-copy-id -i diana@10.97.85.20
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add

sudo apt-get install xterm
To install xterm

ssh -X diana@10.97.85.20
    -X to use xterm

xterm
  Al checks using ps -aux | grep diana and sees that I am running xterm

When I checked to see if Al is running xterm and it works:
al        1806  0.6  0.8   7452  4172 pts/9    S+   01:05   0:00 xterm
